            Hello! I'm Céline, a multidisciplinary artist with a deep passion for creating work that resonates with the world around me. My art is a reflection of my commitment to social justice, as I believe in the power of creativity to drive meaningful change. I explore various mediums, always striving to challenge perceptions and inspire action.
            Beyond my artistic pursuits, I find joy in the little things that bring color to life—whether it's the playful antics of cats, the richness of languages, or the pleasure of sharing a good meal. These interests fuel my imagination and often find their way into my work, adding layers of personal meaning to the broader themes I explore.
            As I continue to grow as an artist, I remain committed to using my voice and talents to advocate for the causes I care about. My work is not just about self-expression but also about fostering connection and understanding, inviting others to see the world through a different lens.
            <br> And as always, free Palestine. From the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.
